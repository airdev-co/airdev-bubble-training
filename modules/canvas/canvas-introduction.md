# Canvas Introduction

## What is Canvas?

AirDev Canvas is a set of tools developed by the professional [Bubble](https://bubble.io) developers at AirDev. We use these products internally as we have found they speed up our workflow and allow us to produce high quality apps, faster.

These tools include:

1. Page templates, which give you the basic functionality you need to make a working app
2. Page builder, which allows you to select page templates and groups to build responsive pages
3. Color updater, to change the colors of all Canvas styles across your app
4. Styles updater, to get the latest Canvas styles if we update the app
5. Developer marketplace, to connect you with Bubble professionals who can work with you on your app
6. Development guide, to learn what we consider to be best practices for building on Bubble

Our [free Bubble template](https://bubble.io/template/canvas-starter-template-1541110863579x114287102114398200) can be used as the foundation for any responsive web application. It is based on AirDev's experience through hundreds of client engagements with clients that range from startups to large enterprises. It includes basic functionality required by most web apps:  login/signup, header, homepage, owner/admin portal, responsiveness, and much more.  

Most of the tools listed above require you to build using the \(free\) AirDev Canvas template, as the tools are built around specific styles and building conventions.

AirDev Canvas is the first \(and as of November 2019, only\) development framework for Bubble.

**For a more visual explanation: see our** [**Canvas about page**](https://canvas.airdev.co/index?tab=about%20%26%20help&sub=what%20is%20canvas%3F) **\(30 second skim\).**

## Why Canvas?

1. Speed of development: Build up to 10x faster
2. Top-notch designs from our experienced Bubble designers
3. Easily connect with Bubble experts through our portal if you hit a wall or need more developing firepower
4. Responsive out of the box

We also do our best to avoid re-making the wheel, following two software development principles: ["KISS" and "DRY"](https://dzone.com/articles/software-design-principles-dry-and-kiss). By using Canvas, you can avoid creating the same basic designs over and over again, molding a base to work for the specific use cases that you are dealing with. There's no need reinvent the wheel \(or the confirmation popup\) for every app you make.

This is similar to why traditional software developers use frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): to quickly build out applications that are pretty, while following professional design patterns and being easy for other developers to understand.
